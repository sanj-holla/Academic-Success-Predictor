# Academic-Success-Predictor
This is my ITCS 3156 final project. This project explores student academic outcomes using supervised machine learning techniques. Using the Student Performance dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the goal is to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on features like prior grades, study habits, family background, and lifestyle choices. Two classification models, Logistic Regression and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), are implemented and compared to analyze both linear and non-linear patterns in student performance data.

Dataset:

Source - UCI Machine Learning Repository â€“ Student Performance Dataset

Features - Includes demographic, academic, behavioral, and family-related variables
